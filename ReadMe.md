# CCD Image Simulator
This program aims to provide an simple but interactive experience on how different factor would effect the resulting image quality in astrophotography.
The code has two versions:
1. AstroDemo.py
The simpler verison which only use functions in numpy and matplotlib. In this program, we assume a gaussian PSF, no readout noise.
2. AstroDemo_Fancy.py
The more complicated version which aims to provide a more sophisticated simulation. Currently, we use 2d airy disk for PSF.

The code is still in development and could contain bugs and mistakes.
